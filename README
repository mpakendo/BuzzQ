BuzzQ takes a query keyword and passes this on to different web service API's:
- Twitter
- Twitpic
- Flickr
The application is still very experimental, consisting of:
a) A UI built with Jquery-UI, Galleria (galleria.io) and very little glue
b) a Node.js server with patches of code from everywhere.

It currently serves as a learning testbed for a variety of technologies:
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Jquery
- Jquery-UI

There are known bugs.

The latest branch (responsivewebdesign) is a construction site as the Node.JS server is being rewritten for Express and EJS templating,
which will also be used in the browser. The UI is in the middle of being ported to Twitter Bootstrap.
