BuzzQ takes a query keyword and passes this on to different web service API's:
- Twitter
- Twitpic
- Flickr
The application is still very experimental, consisting of:
a) A UI built with Jquery-UI, Galleria (galleria.io) and very little glue
b) a Node.js server with patches of code from everywhere.

It currently serves as a learning testbed for a variety of technologies:
- JavaScript
- Node.js
- Jquery
- Jquery-UI
